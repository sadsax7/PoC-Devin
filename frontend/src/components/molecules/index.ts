/**
 * @fileoverview Molecules barrel export.
 *
 * Re-exports all molecule components.
 * Molecules group atoms for focused UI roles (e.g., FormField, OtpCodeInput).
 *
 * @remarks
 * FRONTEND-GUIDELINES.md §3.2 — Molecules.
 * May contain lightweight UI validations but no business logic.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { FormField, OtpCodeInput } from '@/components/molecules';
 * ```

// Export molecules here as they are created.
// Example: export { FormField } from './FormField';
